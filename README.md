### Objective

Match 3 like-colored gems to smash them, and outlast the other player. If the gems reach the top of your screen, you lose.

### Summoning

There are 5 summon monsters
* Red - Pyroclastic Roar - ash rains down on your opponent
* Green - Wind Slash - on your board, smash every gem of a random color
* Blue - Tidal Crash - a tsunami crashes against the cliff face, eroding it
* Yellow: Justice's Light - balance both play areas
* Purple: Grim Gravity - your opponent's gems fall faster

### How to Summon

When the bar is empty, the first gems you smash will determine the color of the summon you work towards. When you smash
enough gems, the summon bar will fill up completely. Then, you press the SUMMON button to activate the monster and its
effect. You can drain the bar at any time with the DRAIN button. Use this to reset the summoning color so you can work
toward a different color.

### Hints

When you or an opponent summons Yellow, odds are that the new gems you get will smash in several places. This refills
the bars very quickly.
